# FuelJewel
## Summary
Application using Python that evaluates the best method of saving money on gas for 2004 era-Chevrolet car models  and whether its worth purchasing gas with credit cards (assuming cash back percentages are 3%) or with cash.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to aid myself in figuring what the best course of action was, concerning the purchase of local gas at the time. The project was originally created during HackRU, but was unable to finish due to the lack of a working API. (That and I would have had to input every car model detail and would have taken too much time for a single night). 

## Instructions
Assuming a Command Prompt usage and you have installed the proper packages onto your system:

-To start up this program, you will need to head to the project's directory. You will also need the pip install untangle your environment for the project to function.

-run venv/scripts/activate in your command prompt.

-and then run trying.py in the command prompt. 

EDIT: A majority of this project is not in the state that I would consider "complete". A mock-up application called trying.py is the latest iteration of the assignment, yet at the moment of documentation, I do not feel comfortable in ending this project in such a state and will probably allocate time after my current assignment to work on this one. 

UPDATE: at the moment of writing, I have made a lot of assumptions, due to lack of information, and simplification. I will be looking at 2004-era Chevy car models in the future, as well as not depending on much user input to output a response. Yet at its current state, it depends on too many assumptions to be considered complete. For an idea of my current thoughts/decisions, look at the Trying.py file and the comments within the file.
